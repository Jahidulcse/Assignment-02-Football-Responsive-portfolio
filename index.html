                    <p>The 2021 Copa América was the 47th edition of the Copa América, the international men's
                        football championship organised by South America's football ruling body CONMEBOL. The
                        tournament took place in Brazil from 13 June to 10 July 2021.[2] The tournament was
                        originally scheduled to take place from 12 June to 12 July 2020 in Argentina and Colombia as
                        the 2020 Copa América. On 17 March 2020, CONMEBOL announced that due to the COVID-19
                        pandemic in South America, the tournament had been postponed for a year, in conjunction with
                        UEFA's decision to also postpone UEFA Euro 2020 to 2021.[3] This was the first time since
                        1991 where no guest nation took part in the tournament.</p>
